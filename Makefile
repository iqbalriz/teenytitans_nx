# Teeny Titans -- Nintendo Switch wrapper (32-bit / AArch32, Unity 2017.4 IL2CPP)
#
# Ships NO game code and NO game assets: the game's own APK and expansion
# file (the player's copy) are read at run time, and its libraries are
# unpacked from the APK on the first launch.
#
# Built on aks796's dcr_sea_nx (Disney Crossy Road, MIT): the same Unity layer,
# with the Mono parts replaced by IL2CPP's (source/il2cpp_rt.c).
#
# The build is the android32 runtime's (runtime/runtime.mk: devkitARM +
# libnx32 + mesa32 from portlibs32/); ./build.sh runs it in the toolchain
# container. Output: teenytitans_nx.nsp, which the launcher NRO carries (launcher/).
